This ain't your run of the mill pomodoro timer. This one is minimal.
Never been done before, I reckon.

At the moment I haven't launched the app anywhere yet, so
you'll have to just download the repo into a folder and 
open **'index.html'**.

Feel free to contact me about any bugs.
I only have a butterfly case but it'll do.
